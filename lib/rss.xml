 <br>Yoo, wasup??<br>I'm Alex, a 17 years old student getting into cybersec. I was bored this summer and decided to make a site.<br>For you, yes you, who is taking a look right now, I know what you're doing here, decided to check the gen Z mode with some hope.<br>
Well look no further ma guy/girl.<br>I know. Checking all this yapping of documentation and walkthroughs doesn't pair well with the 2 secs of attention span. That's why I'm here.<br>If you made it this far congrats! I, my self was starting to get bored. Feel free to check my gen Z walkthroughs but don't expect any technical details, these will be hosted on my normal site, BUT these walkthroughs will make it aðŸŒ·lovelyðŸŒ·happyðŸŒ·journeyðŸŒ· for you and your low attention span. No diss!<br>-etcdrf]]></description><link>About me.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">About me.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 18:43:32 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
